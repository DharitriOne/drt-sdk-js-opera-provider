# drt-sdk-js-opera-provider

Signing provider for dApps: Opera Crypto Wallet. 

Documentation is available on [docs.dharitri.com](https://docs.dharitri.com/sdk-and-tools/moajs/moajs-signing-providers/), while an integration example can be found [here](https://github.com/DharitriOne/drt-sdk-js-examples/tree/main/signing-providers).

Note that **we recommend using [dapp-core](https://github.com/DharitriOne/drt-sdk-dapp)** instead of integrating the signing provider on your own.
